#SynchronousDeferred

This is an alternative implementation of two classes:

 - twisted.internet.defer.Deferred
 - twisted.python.failure.Failure

These classes allow you to write a library that provides both asynchronous and synchronous
interfaces to your code.

They're not complete implementations of the entire interfaces, but they might become more thorough
once this code gets some serious use.
